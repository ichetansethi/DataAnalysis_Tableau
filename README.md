# DataAnalysis_Tableau
Data Analysis Project on Tableau for AirBnB about the trend in pricing, occupancy, and number of rooms available.
The link for the dashboard is: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chetan.sethi/viz/AirBnBDAProject/Dashboard1?publish=yes

This link has a dashboard for the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset?resource=download

Through this project, many of the client's questions are answered like, which area has the most expensive rooms or how many Airbnb have how many number of rooms.
This dashboard also explains the revenue generated for the financial year 2016-17.
I have tried to arrange the dataset in the most representative way.
